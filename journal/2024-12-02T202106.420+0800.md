### Status:
after doing absolutely nothing and feeling guilty again, as always
### Thoughts:
Here are my key motivations to remind myself whenever I feel tired and going to procrastinate
- You have started the procrastination way too long time ago. "The best time to start was back then, the second best time to start is NOW"
- I am on the right track, just keep learning and by the time of next year, you would have already been prepared for 1 whole year
- You are the memory hero 
- You are the mastery of computer software
- You are born to hack into games and become the god of every single games 
- You are born to be the god of internet
- Would you like the pain of keep moving and forcing yourself to make progress, or the pain of procrastination in the future?
- CTF is actually fun with enough knowledge and practical work, as well as the knowledge gain during the work. And most importantly the joy of breaking things and understanding them thoroughly
- Focus on myself and your precious work, the knowledge you accuminalated and all the joy associated with them. Build social connection here and focus on that, not something far away from you (streams)
