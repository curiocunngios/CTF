In this CTF, and JerseyCTF, I was only able to solve those challenges that are extremely beginner level.

# Sniper


There's something I don't know about format string. Now I know it. It's something about the $ 


# Debug-2 

I had an idea but I didn't bother even trying. Probably because I am lazy and not confident enough


# Hexstone

I had an idea but I didn't bother even trying. Probably because I am lazy and not confident enough

the fact that Atopos did it (with my idea of ROP chain + format string), I feel very sad, angry (towards myself), hate myself for being lazy


I also feel jealous for the potential huge amount of satisfaction Atopos got from the challenge. Because I could have be the one who tasted the satisfaction. 


I did not bother even trying out my idea, just because I think it is not the intended solution (in fact it's not)
And the fact that I need to leak libc addresses to leak the version annoys me. 

But those frustration are actually, most of time, the prerequisite to achieving excellences, solving tough problems, actually hacking.

Try harder, brother, always, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder, try harder



it's the fact that I did not really care much about the challenges on the CTF competitions. I really did not care much about them. What I care more about, are the challenges on pwn.college

So, my next step, is to grind at pwn.college, write writeups for the challenges in pwn.college, make videos, walkthroughs


whenever you learnt something new, something a bit overwhelming, something interesting, something amazing. For example, bruteforcing and partial overwrite, unsafe unlink, House of einherjar etc.


Please

Please


please


please


write writeup for the challenge, rewire your neural links

and 


mark down the challenge


re-do it again in the future


Or re-do similar ones again 


in the future 



so that you have successfully learnt it, learnt everything related to it, opened up the pattern recognition switch in your brain so that you recognize those challenges that relates to it as if you recognize a simple ret2libc pwn challenge


Also, don't forget about your c++ grind. You also need to know a lot about programming.
