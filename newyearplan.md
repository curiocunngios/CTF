# I did not do very well in this year's competition:
> Perfect excuse here but I have been legit mentally very unable from start to end. Probably because of being nervous and caffeine (never drink too much coffee, you can't handle the energy)

> I wanted to solve challenges too badly that I was too impatient so I overlooked some crucial opportunities

the fact that 20 non null bytes payload actually overwrites one null byte to neighbour heap addresses and I overlooked this completely even though I was sending the correct payload. I was relying on claude too much and believing it would just overwrite the neight heap address completely.   
With foundational knowledge, being able to not care, be calm, stable, patient and observant is always the key. That was also my main weapon which leaded me to be able to solve 2024 track A homework challenges.  
Might have also overlooked some opportunities in TwTOF. But to be honest, that was when I was mentally stable after finally solving my first pwn challenge guess-the-number.

> Tried to focus alone for too long and burnt out. 

When I took a break and sort of admitting my failure to teammates, I solved one challenge very soon.   
From this result, the ideal strategy would have been:   
I full focused and knew pretty much everything (knowledge points) of the challenge, endure a bit more and if I can't do it share that to teammates. Then, move on to other challenges until your teammates gives some insights. But not focusing on the challenge alone for hours for your ego, then gets frustrated, tired and mentally challenged and completely disconnected from teammates.  

Therefore, I think a good CTF player would actually share and contribute, communicate by a lot. While being able to quickly switch focus and focus well on challenges. But the prerequisite of that is strong foundation knowledge, confidence and a mentally healthy mind, which would be my target this year.

Anyways, there are always time when people fail. The key is to be able to reflect, learn from it. Then, forget about it and move on. ~~To learn from it, perhaps I can apply some flashcard syntaxes on this note~~

# Expected self-improvements in the new year:
> Slowly build up foundational knowledge of hacking, full focus on reverse and pwn. (~~web starting from september~~)

Study funndational knowledge with flashcards via platforms like hackthebox, comp3633 binary content, consistently attending CTF events focusing on reverse and pwn.

For example, master assembly of MIPS, x86-64, arch, etc. You can learn a few a the same time, just mapping the instructions, telling the differences, understanding and remembering them.  
But in order to understand and memorize well, you are strongly recommended to do some challenges related to it. So, the strategy is to not learn until you are on a challenge related to it. But once you start to learn, learn it all!

> Develop health mind and be mentally consistent

- See doctor, believe him
- mindfulness (I believe this is key to being fast, productive and stable)
- sleep well and at regular times, this is the strictest rule of the entire year and your life
- Understand that you don't have to be fast, be consistent and stable (start by fixing your typing habits)
- When you care about something, remind yourself whether you should really care about it or not.
- Just be normal. For example, eating normally.kv

Hopefully you can do it, treat your coming exams in HKUST as practices.

So... all I wanted, is simply self-developments and slowly become exceptional. Then fucking do it, in a smart way (e.g. strategically you never have to be fast and impatient). I am ambitious as hell and now my ultimate goal for this year, is to:  With my next team in Firebird 2026 internal competition, win it again while achieving full-solve pwn and reverse challenges with my team.
