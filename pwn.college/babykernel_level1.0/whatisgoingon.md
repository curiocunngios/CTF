Ah, great question! You're right that this is totally different from normal userspace interaction. Let me explain what's happening:

## Normal userspace interaction (what you're used to):
```bash
./binary          # Start a program
<waiting for input>
hello             # Type input to stdin
<output stuff>    # Program prints to stdout
```

The program is **running** and **waiting** for your input.

## Kernel module interaction (what's happening here):
```bash
echo "euxscnoiramxamcf" > /proc/pwncollege
```

**No program is running and waiting!** Instead:

1. **The kernel module** is already loaded in memory (like a background service)
2. **`/proc/pwncollege`** is like a "magic file" that the module created
3. **Writing to this file** triggers the module's `device_write()` function
4. **Reading from this file** triggers the module's `device_read()` function

## Think of it like this:

### Normal program:
```
You ↔ Terminal ↔ Program
```

### Kernel module:
```
You ↔ Terminal ↔ /proc/pwncollege ↔ Kernel Module
```

The `/proc/pwncollege` file is like a **mailbox** that the kernel module is monitoring.

## What actually happens:

```bash
# This line:
echo "euxscnoiramxamcf" > /proc/pwncollege

# Translates to:
1. echo writes "euxscnoiramxamcf" 
2. > redirects it to /proc/pwncollege
3. Linux kernel sees: "someone is writing to /proc/pwncollege"
4. Kernel calls: device_write(file, "euxscnoiramxamcf", 16, offset)
5. device_write() runs the password check
6. Function returns, operation complete
```

## Reading works the same way:

```bash
cat /proc/pwncollege

# Translates to:
1. cat tries to read from /proc/pwncollege
2. Linux kernel sees: "someone is reading from /proc/pwncollege" 
3. Kernel calls: device_read(file, buffer, length, offset)
4. device_read() returns the appropriate message
5. cat displays what device_read() returned
```

## The key difference:

**Normal program**: Interactive conversation
```bash
./program
> What's your name?
John
> Hello John!
```

**Kernel module**: One-shot file operations
```bash
echo "input" > /proc/device    # Send data (triggers device_write)
cat /proc/device               # Get response (triggers device_read)
```

## Visual comparison:

### Userspace program workflow:
```
Terminal → Program (running) → Program processes → Program responds
```

### Kernel module workflow:
```
Terminal → File operation → Kernel calls module function → Module responds immediately
```

## Try this to see the difference:

```bash
# Normal program (if it existed):
./password_checker
Please enter password: euxscnoiramxamcf
Correct! Here's your flag: pwn{...}

# Kernel module (what you're actually doing):
echo "euxscnoiramxamcf" > /proc/pwncollege  # Just writes and exits
cat /proc/pwncollege                        # Just reads and exits
```

The kernel module is **always running** in the background, and the `/proc/pwncollege` file is its **interface** to userspace!

Does this help clarify the difference?
