# movzx
`movzx ecx,BYTE PTR [rax+rdx*1]`:
- `movzx` = move with {{zero extension}}

## Zero extensions
```
Original byte: 1010 1100
Zero extension to 32 bits:
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1010 1100

vs Sign extension would be (if byte was signed):
1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1010 1100 
(if original byte's MSB was 1)
```
- we doing zero extension because the value is specifically treated as {{unsigned value}}
- The `movzx` instruction is specifically used when we want to treat the byte as an {{unsigned value. }}

The choice between `movzx` (zero extend) and `movsx` (sign extend) depends on whether the byte should be interpreted as:
- {{unsigned (0 to 255)}}
- {{signed (-128 to 127)}}

The compiler chooses `movzx` here because either:
1. The {{original C code explicitly used unsigned char}}
2. Or the context requires treating this byte as unsigned




```as
115a:	8b 45 fc             	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
    115d:	83 e8 02             	sub    eax,0x2
    1160:	48 98                	cdqe
    1162:	48 8d 15 17 2f 00 00 	lea    rdx,[rip+0x2f17]        # 4080 <f> # loads base address
    1169:	0f b6 0c 10          	movzx  ecx,BYTE PTR [rax+rdx*1]
```


The movzx (move with zero-extend) instruction:

    Takes a byte (8 bits) from memory
    Extends it to 32 bits (ecx) by adding zeros in the upper bits
    For example:
        If byte value is 0x7F, it becomes 0x0000007F in ecx
        If byte value is 0xFF, it becomes 0x000000FF in ecx


Ah, I was showing it as a 32-bit representation (since we're working with `ecx`), but you're right - `0xFF` by itself is just 8 bits:

```
0xFF in 8-bit binary:  1111 1111

# When we say & 0xFF, it's just:
Some value:    xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 1010 1100
0xFF:          0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1111
After AND:     0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1010 1100
```

To break down `0xFF`:
- `0x` means hexadecimal notation
- `FF` in hex = `1111 1111` in binary
  - F in hex = `1111` in binary
  - So FF = `1111 1111`

I showed the longer 32-bit version because the `movzx` instruction extends the 8-bit value to 32 bits in `ecx`, but you're absolutely right - `0xFF` itself is just 8 bits. I should have been clearer about that distinction.


### how does 0xFF make things unsigned 

Let me clarify - when you do `& 0xFF`, the mask `0xFF` (8 ones) is effectively extended to match the size of the value being masked, but with zeros in all higher positions. This is how bitwise AND works in Python:

```python
# Let's say we have a 16-bit value:
x = 0b1111000011110000  # 16 bits

# When we do x & 0xFF, Python effectively does:
# x:              1111 0000 1111 0000
# extended 0xFF:  0000 0000 1111 1111
# result:         0000 0000 1111 0000

# Another example with negative number:
x = -50  # might be represented as many bits internally
# x in binary:    ...1111 1111 1100 1110  (many 1s in front due to negative)
# extended 0xFF:  ...0000 0000 1111 1111
# result:                    1100 1110  (just the last 8 bits)
```

So when I said "only the lowest 8 bits will be non-zero", I meant that the result will match the original number's lowest 8 bits where they overlap with the mask's ones, and all higher bits will be zero because they're being AND-ed with zeros from the extended mask.

I apologize for my confusing earlier explanation - it's not that the mask is the same size as the value, but rather the shorter mask is effectively extended with zeros when the operation is performed.


### Exactly correct!

In Python, `& 0xFF` just masks to ensure we're treating the value as unsigned 8-bit (0-255 range). It doesn't extend anything.

The `movzx` in assembly does two distinct operations:
1. Gets the byte value (like the masking in Python)
2. Explicitly extends it to 32 bits by adding zeros in the upper bits

To simulate both operations in Python, we'd need to do something like:
```python
# Just masking (what & 0xFF does):
value = 0xFF
masked = value & 0xFF  # just ensures 8-bit unsigned value
# masked = 11111111

# What movzx actually does (mask AND extend):
extended = masked | (0x00 << 8) | (0x00 << 16) | (0x00 << 24)
# extended = 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111

# But in Python we rarely need to do this extension 
# since Python integers can be any size
```

So you're right - the `& 0xFF` in Python handles just the unsigned conversion part, not the zero-extension that `movzx` does.
