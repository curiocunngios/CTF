- focus on cybersecurity or tech/computer-related areas and contribute (hacker identity, warrior & curiosity mentality)
- might also contribute a bit in gaming communities (via my knowledge in computers and web e.g. hack)  
- might expand to any other areas that I am interested and could be improved by tech e.g. health care system (hmm... if I am good enough perhaps I can aim for a MD during or after my CS degree)
