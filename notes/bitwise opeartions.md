 In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a {{bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as a bit string) at the level of its individual bits}}. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher-level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bitwise operations are presented as {{two-operand instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands.}}
