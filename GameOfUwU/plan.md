## To-do 
(ok, just thought about something a crazy plan, ~~some fantasies~~ but i think is possible if I work really really hard and enough) 
1. full focus on pwn and reverse challenges, category now (unless I feel like I am at a high level and it's too hard to make any progress)
2. treat the competition just as a game lol 
3. don't aim for no.1 anymore, it's likely not happening. Instead, aim to finish all pwn challenges, ~~which is likely not going to happen as well XD~~ 
4. my plan is to deal with pwn and binary shits now, next sem full focus 2711, 2011, CTF related courses etc. to refine my skills and prepare for web and crypto challenges
5. and from summer (late May) to September, I full focus on more advanced CTF challenges
6. 2025 fall enroll in 2633 again, play, study 2012, full focus, on really advanced pwn and some crypto challenges
7. throughout your journey, always focus on learning, refining problem solvign skills and mechanical skills like typical code, focus, etc. 
8. go solo and aim for rank 1 loooooollllll
