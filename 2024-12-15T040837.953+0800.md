### Status:
after waking up in my 5-6 hours of sleep 
### Thoughts:
I was brushing my teeth and I somehow obsessively thought about what usually makes me feel stressed:
- doing pointless things (wasting time on totally unnecessary stuff, behaviors that doesn't match my identity)
- social (whatsapp chat, imaginations about conversations and obsession towards it)
- stuffing too much in my mind (confusion about knowledge and constantly having blurred vision of it in brain)
- academic progress as well as comparison (kind of a social stress?)
- having feelings and obsession that does not match my ideal identity
