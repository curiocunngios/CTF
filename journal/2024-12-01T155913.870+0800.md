### Status:
came back from joggling, rope jumping and a bath 
### Thoughts:
Takeaway from reflection:
- focus and mindfulness (which helps you to switch your focus on something that worth more) {you get to enjoy more of the process itself}
- focus on practical stuff rather than reading the theory {although understanding is essentially the most important, you don't gain much from solely focusing on the reading, thinking in your mind and asking questions in just the process of thinking. Also, it's extremely frustrating to focus on reading something not familiar}
- speed run the process of reading and gain quick understanding
- focus significantly on actually playing with the tools, the exploitation techniques and asking questions around it
- avoid caffeine and focus healthy, consistent eating, sleeping which reinforces a consistent learning stateo
