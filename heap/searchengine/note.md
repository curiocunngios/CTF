# Start 

I have came back to this challenge after a one day break. And I really do have no idea on how to start. Because I did make a little progress but not much, more specifically, I kind of finished reading and "understanding" the source code. 

But now I kinda forgot about what's happening in this challenge, so it feels hard to start. 
Perhaps I should just go back to read the source code again, but this time, draw as well!


So earlier I got into the game by being patient and looking at the source once again. Now I am out of the game because I checked email, got my mind attached to enrolling the comp3633 course first. And attached to discord chat.

Now perhaps i should look into he source code again, try to write something on paper and develop a better understanding into it. Also, you play with the pwndbg to see what's actually happening inside the memory.
