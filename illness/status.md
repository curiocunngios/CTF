# Overview on the weeks i took lexapro 
![alt text](mood.png)

# first 2 week
No worth mentioning i guess...
- sleep 5-6 am everyday 
- takes pills at that time before sleep 
- sleep feel decent at least
- nothing special 


Worth mentioning point:

- first few times I took at night and it made me hyped. 
- there was in total 5 days which I did not take pills, but I never skip for 2 days in a row 
- there were about 2 times which I took it in the morning with breakfast after a very long time of not sleeping, video games and feels like vomitting. 



# week 3 
- still nothing special 
- but started healthy lifestyle 
- officially went under Leave from Study, started going to school everyday under supervision of a counselor in my school 
- Did not intentionally plan to stop and eventually didn't feel like play games so 0 video games and not much twitch and not much porn. And not obsessed with them at all, everything seems to have went balanced

- quite regular and about 6-7 hours of sleep a day 
- same at nearly the same time 12 am - 1 am everyday 
- immeidately fall asleep. "Wake up" usually after 4-5 hrs but it's like half-wake-up, like blinked for a second, heard a bit of sound that my family makes and immediately fell back into sleep 


- started to have an obsession on achieving a goal that requires extreme amount of studying cybersecurity related knowledge, specifically CTF(main motivation is probably 尋求認同 + future benefits + interested and match in identity, since I feel like I am born for this) 好早之前以經有個癮想專心學呢樣嘢

# week 4 
- first time taking 10 mg day 1, nothing special
- second day 10 mg lexapro at night taken after about 34 hours 
- instant hype during post-dinner-lexapro walk on the street 

then started taking 10 mg regularly 

- everyday, at night, feels extreme joy, cozy, relaxed somehow but with trouble sleeping
- starting from day 2, 3 I have made huge progress and achievements in studying and got super interested during and after the process of studying, I got interested because of the fun in creating notes, solving challenges and during the process I feel the connection between different knowledge I learnt before and perhaps the happiness was enhanced by effect of lexapro. My identity feel like starting to change and it made it kinda wanna fully transform to someone who study do not play gmaes
- despite that, I played some games at night during those days but I do not feel guilty because I was never obsessed with video games. My plan on playing video games was under the advisor of couselors to reach to a level of balance between video games and studying. Also, I was simply just happy in doing anything.
- But I am getting more obsessed into progress and performance in studying CTF  
- which later my extremely fatigue yesterday fully overwhelmed me because I couldn't manage to make a single progress




# stuff I would regret not mentioning while seeing doctor 




## trouble sleeping with 10 mg at night 
I have trouble sleep at my last few days of 5 mg (taken in morning) and it got worse when I started 10 mg ( taken at night )

all of the days I took 10 mg lexapro reguarly at night, i felt quite calm, energized at night despite frequent yawns during regular sleep time

## contradiction with super good effect on taking it at night followed by a walk (super happy )
although it seems to be disrupting my sleep at night, it also seemed to be quite effective

10 mg at night after dinner seemed to have made me extremely happy (especially during my post-dinner-lexapro leisure walk on the street, the world just feels beautiful, everything seems perfect. For no matter what happened it seems like it would be fine) together with sense of achievement and fulfillment of big learning progress in studying


How my huge sense of achievements from studying progress and perhaps together with effect of the pill, made me extremely happy and warmth, relaxed and feels like everything turns good, "the world looks super cute today"

I want to achieve in CTF so bad and fantasize myself on going on a monk journey of low dopamine and with full embrace of work, that I kinda brainwashed myself to change an identity fully to become a CTF grinder (full grind, people who watch streams or any shows and do not embrace the beauty of work (sense of achievement of creating things, in my case it's making notes and building up knowledge for myself))



## how did that big drop happened:
it all happened from one night on sunday

0. couldn't sleep until like 5-6 am on saturday and only ended up sleeping 4 hours even tho I slept super late was probably a 鋪墊 )i am not lying on bad until 6 am. It has always been pretty quick for me to realize that I pretty much can't sleep so i just get up and work 
1. confusion, realization and worry about my sleep and how badly it could disrupt my mastery grind on CTF 
2. confusion about myself because I feel like becoming weird. Because I have never been feeling like this during my sleep, that I would fall asleep feeling filled energy but not tiredness. Like 有精神地睡著. And i feel like my thoughts has been so messy, like sometimes I just think about something out of no where in the middle of thinking about something else. I couldn't manage to focus on thinking just one thing in my mind
3. just a tons of worries suddenly comes on the night i couldn't fall asleep on sunday. 

The worries does not come from no where:

because lately:

1. can't sleep easily
2. 耳嗚特別大聲 during week 4 while studying and also while wearing headphones, sleeping. The sound that beeee in my ear changes a bit when I move my jaws 
3. my jaws and tmjd doesn't situation got worse given I most probably have tmjd since I grinds my teeth at night and the places around my ears feels stiff and tensed chronically

the fact that I am always so 呆 lately, like i would literally forget things I think about seconds ago and space out for a few seconds not know what to do, where am I 

and just yesterday, i feel exhausted and I cannot focus at all. I was so fragile and tired in school that i could make no progress. 


I take my pill yesterday at 3 pm and I did not get the super happy feeling any more

when i went back home I started watching twitch again and since it was against my grinder identity, i just felt like a loser

I just feel tired and sleepy, hop to bed and thoughts and worries comes up. Got stressed again, can't sleep 

## My chronic inability to focus, fatigue and heart palpitations

I remember you (the doctor) asking that whether I am a person who always cannot focus, like since when I am young chrnoically
I first answered yes but then kind of refused as I thought about moments of myself being able to focus, specifically when I was able to immerse in books when I am not studying any courses, which was not really the case when I thought about it deeply. I now remmeber that I also had to use a ruler to highlight words to be able to focus, I kept having random thoughts while reading the book

even now, whenever I am doing something, either I space out not know where am I, who I am. Or I just consistently having random thoughts popping up my head, usually thoughts related to relationships, my studying progress, my personal image

I realized that I always feel stressed when i am not moving. Like when I am sittign down and reading, I just kinda have to shake my legs or I am feel my heart literally smashing and racing. Also when I am lying down on bed, my heart races sometimes but if I move my head, legs, hand, or just a finger. The disturbing feeling of abnormal rate and smash of heartbeats is like gone
## self centerness 
> usually thoughts related to relationships, my studying progress, my personal image

this is the root cause of everything I guess
