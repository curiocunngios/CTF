I think reviewing homeworks by doing them again is not necessary. I should just review them by reading and fixing my own writeups, or adding more details, or by utilizing other solving methods on those past challenges.    
For the familarity of using tools and docker, I should get used to them by trying out all the different challenges throughout the week.    
Although it is surely going to be exciting solving the challenges,    
please remember to take breaks, stand up, have a walk, exercise, take some snacks, meditate, wind down, be mindful of thoughts in general etc.  Most importantly, have sufficient sleep every day.
