Feeling demotivated to grind or study after eating is a common experience. Here are some practical suggestions to help you regain focus and energy after meals:

1. Adjust Your Meals
Eat Lightly: Heavy meals can make you feel sluggish due to the body diverting energy to digestion. Opt for lighter, balanced meals with a good mix of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs.
Example: Grilled chicken with a small portion of quinoa and a side of veggies.
Stay Hydrated: Drink water during your meal but avoid excessive amounts to prevent bloating.
Avoid Sugar Overload: High-sugar meals or desserts can cause an energy crash.
2. Plan for a Short Break
Schedule a Post-Meal Routine: Take a short 10–15 minute walk or do light stretches to help with digestion and refresh your mind.
A brisk walk outside can also provide fresh air and sunlight, boosting alertness.
Relax Intentionally: Use this time to listen to music, a podcast, or do a quick mindfulness exercise instead of jumping back into work immediately.
3. Structure Your Study Time Wisely
Start with Low-Effort Tasks: Begin with simpler, less cognitively demanding activities (e.g., reviewing notes or watching a tutorial) to ease into the grind.
Set a Timer: Use the Pomodoro Technique to build momentum:
25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break.
Use Incentives: Promise yourself a small reward (e.g., coffee, a snack, or a quick YouTube video) after completing your first post-meal session.
4. Boost Your Environment
Optimize Your Workspace: Move to a clean, bright area with minimal distractions.
Play Energy-Boosting Music: Instrumental or upbeat tracks can help energize you without being too distracting.
5. Harness Physical Stimulation
Cold Splash: Wash your face with cold water or use a damp cloth to refresh.
Exercise Briefly: Do jumping jacks, push-ups, or any quick exercise to get your blood flowing.
6. Mental Strategies
Break Big Tasks into Smaller Goals: Knowing you only need to tackle a small piece can reduce procrastination.
Visualize Success: Remind yourself of why you're grinding (e.g., that moment of solving a tough challenge in the competition).
Sample Post-Lunch Routine
Meal Time (12:00 PM - 12:30 PM): Eat a light meal, avoid overstuffing.
Digest & Recharge (12:30 PM - 12:45 PM): Take a walk or listen to calming music.
Ease Into Work (12:45 PM - 1:00 PM): Organize your desk, review light materials.
Focus Session (1:00 PM - 1:25 PM): Begin with a low-effort task using the Pomodoro technique.
Experiment with these strategies to see what works best for you. If you’re consistent, your body and mind will start adapting to the new routine! 🚀















Normally, students in school study in an interval wide enough and comfortable enough for them to learn, practice and digest a something.

An university student example:
```
September to Janunary, they study:


12 more credits on typical computer science introductory courses:

_intro to c++_ (3 credits):
_discrete mathematics_ (3 credits):
_linear algebra_ (3 credits):
_english language_ (3 credits):

which the above 12 credits involves the following rules:
- about 2 - 3  lectures each week ( each takes about 1.5 hour)
- about 3 to 4 assignments in the interval from September to December, might have some small labs in-between 
- one midterm and one final exam packed on the last month

PLUS one very special course about hacking and CTF: 
_COMP2633 Competitive Programming in Cybersecurity I_ : (6 credits for people with absolutely no prerequisites)
- 5 hrs of lectures per week to give a brief introduction to CTF topics. For example, 1 week on linux and regex and CLI, 1 week on reverse engineering and web intro and assembly, 1 week on learning tools like ghidra and cryptography attack another week on stack migration, ROP, GOT hijacking and RSA attack etc.  
- provide challenging CTF exercises with a time limit of 2 weeks to solve, in order to encourage students to self-explore the details on each topic  
- about 9 weeks in total 
```

I believe with the above typical pathway design and planning for the University students, they can all learn efficiently and in a comfortable and enjoyable way that is not too frustrating

# Background of myself 
Now that the date is 8th of december, I am somebody who one week ago has absolutely no prerequisites and has nothing else to do but planned to fully focusing on just this one particular course, area about hacking:
`Competitive Programming in Cybersecurity I(6 credits for people with absolutely no prerequisites)`

I have started for a week since 1st of dec, skipped reverse fundamentals like assembly language and ghidra, ignored web challenges and concepts. But I have made quite a lot of progress on PWN with several buffer overflow challenges. I now have a brief understanding in computer memory (e.g. how stack pointers rbp and rsp works function calls)
I have about 1 month left to learn and prepare for a pretty challenging CTF competition. 

# My question is:

In what way can I focus and learn effectively and digest effectively to be as competitive as, or even go beyond those typical students who immersed in courses in the course of 4 months from September to January, again I think I stood a chance because I am just focusing on this one course `Competitive Programming in Cybersecurity I` about CTF. Since now it's december, those typical students have already finished the entire syllabus `Competitive Programming in Cybersecurity I` but they are probably preparing for final exams of all other courses as well as the CTF competition simultaneously. So I think I might have a chance to catch up 

TLDR: 
So I guess my question is like asking what is the general direction of learning in such non-ordinary and compressed way, but fully focus on just one course to catch up.

I don't mind, and is kind of expecting to be learning in a frustrating way because I deserved it as I heavily procrastinated. 
by the way, not sure if this matters, but I am someone with background OCD, ADHD and asperger syndrome.

CTF exercises and FAQ
The CTF exercises are hosted at the firebird web : <URL TO CHALLENGING CTF CHALLENGES DESIGNED BY COURSE HELPERS>

Question: I know this course requires me to do a lot of self-learning. Is there any good site I can explore for self-learning materials?

Answer: Yes, there are a lot of websites for self-learning CTF knowledge. Here are some of the websites we have came across:
The PWN college. It has an extensive discussion on PWN (by Ryder)
Cryptohack. It is a platform for learning cryptopgraphy (by TWY and Ryder)
Crytopals crypto challenges. It consists of a total of 48 crypto related challenges (by TWY and Ryder)
Awesome CTF. It consists of a relatively comprehensive collection of CTF related materials (by TWY and Ryder)
Capture The Flag 101. It consists of a nice collection of CTF related materials (by TWY and Ryder)
Payloads All The Things. It consists of a nice collection of useful payloads for track B (by Albert)
libc database. It has a database for identifying libc version by providing the address information of some of the libc symbols (by Eric)













I can't wait the send the following message to the CTF discord:

hello everyone, here are my overly detailed and beginner-friendly write-ups of every challenges on firebird training platform 

ofc it does not have to be my first message. I can still learn and ask a lot of questions before all that


ok i am starting to imagine some more conversaitons between me and firebird members xd. Actually maybe no one cares about me xd
