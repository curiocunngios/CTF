# Challenge description 

I had a very special flag that was unlike any other flag in the world. It was colorful, vibrant and had the power to bring people together. I loved my flag more than anything in the world, but I was very protective of it. I didn't want to share it with anyone, as I feared it might lose its magic.

However, people from all over the world heard about my flag and wanted to see it for themselves. They begged me to show it to them, but I refused.

One day, I came up with an idea. I decided to express myself through emoticons. I created a series of emoticons that represented the colors and symbols of my flag. I posted these emoticons on social media, and people were amazed by them. ( ˶ •́ ω •̀ ˶ )
