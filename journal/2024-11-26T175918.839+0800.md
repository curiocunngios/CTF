### Status:
after solving the command line injection 3 
### Thoughts:
- you were completely mindless, not reading and observing at all, only copy and pasting and using chatgpt and kept asking questions
- well at least you were reading gpt's words not that mindlessly since you had been asking questions
- but pretty stupid and basics one still 
- maybe it'd be better to find the writeups first lol 
- I have been relying a bit too much on chatgpt, basically just copy and pasting
- maybe you can focus on doing that and documenting + writing writeups to learn even more concepts
- start leaving some time in the day to actually practice doing it yourself (writing linux commands and scripts) 
- gradually increase the amount of time in practice when you have kinda catch up the progress (in terms of just knowledge)
- and since you were also not docujmenting earlier, better do as soon as possible (tonight) before the amount of knowledge increases to a point that you don't wish to catch up documenting anymore. 

tasks tonight

- document the things you leanr in the past by:
- going through your entire chat with chatgpt by just reading it and jotting down key points, maybe with snippets (some are redundant and you can skip, just read smart)
- finish the write ups for the challenges you have done so far (command injection 1 and 3, local authority etc.)
- revise the first ctf lecture slide again and google / gpt anything interested
- finish the remaining week 1 challenges
- move on to week 2 pdf and videos

tomorrow

- morning: week 3 theory (web + reverse revise) + documentation
- afternoon: challenges + gpt + documentation
- evening: writeups + refine your documentation

time in-between (maybe try starting the latest challenges lol)

goal: be confident enough that you don't need the competition to prove yourself, you have already proven yourself with the many hard challenges you solved or you are confident with how fucking much you fucking know and is profficent at. (e.g. reading assembly)
