`0x7ffc0d435a48` shows the content of canary, how can we call the `content`? do we call them values of the stack, and how about the addresses? Those are called the addresses on the stack?

# answer
Let's break this down:

`0x7ffc0d435a48` is indeed a stack address (notice the 7fff/7ffc prefix typical of stack addresses).

For terminology:

1. The address (`0x7ffc0d435a48`):
- Called "stack address"
- Or "address on the stack"
- Or "stack pointer"

2. The content/values stored there (`0x00 0x54 0x08...`):
- Called "stack values"
- Or "values on the stack"
- Or "stack contents"
- In this specific case, it's the "canary value"

In your example:
```
Address on stack     Values/Contents on stack
0x7ffc0d435a48:     0x00 0x54 0x08 0x43 0xd2 0xc3 0xc6 0x73
```

When describing the canary:
- "The canary is stored at address 0x7ffc0d435a48"
- "The canary value is 0x73c6c3d243085400"
- "The stack contains the canary value 0x73c6c3d243085400"

The preceding bytes (`0x41 0x41...`) are:
- Values/contents on the stack
- In this case, they're 'A' characters (0x41 in ASCII)
