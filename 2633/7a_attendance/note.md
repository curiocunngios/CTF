- morning 23/12/2024 
- I have just realized that i have always been feeling absolutely shit after waking but I just didn't care 
- I just my current mode of studying CTF is a bit too stressful 
- full focusing is good, but do it in a smart way 
- new rules: set time limits:25 minutes full focus on going through a particular part of the question 
- for example, 25 minutes of exploration, testing
- 25 minutes of solution thinking
- 25 minutes of solve script writing 
- final 25 minutes to think, if u still have no clue 
- skip, relax, go to other topics and come back only after feeling refreshed 
- prioritize sleep 
- whenever you feel stress, rethink what you are doing, you should be doing something wrong
