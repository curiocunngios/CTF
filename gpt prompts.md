Let me break this down in detail:

1. **Stack Alignment & Saved Registers:**
- **Alignment**: Memory addresses should be multiples of certain values (usually 16 bytes on x86_64) for performance
  ```
  Example: If you need 10 bytes, it might allocate 16 to keep aligned
  0x1000: [used][used][used]....[pad][pad] (16 bytes total)
  ```
- **Saved Registers**: When a function starts, it may need to use registers that calling function is using
  - These registers' values must be preserved
  - They're saved on stack at function start (prologue)
  - Restored before function returns (epilogue)
  ```nasm
  ; Prologue example
  push ebp      ; Save old base pointer
  mov ebp, esp  ; Create new stack frame
  push ebx      ; Save ebx if we'll use it
  ```

1. **Program Counter/Instruction Pointer:**
- PC/IP are the same thing ("/" means "or")
- On x86: Called EIP (32-bit) or RIP (64-bit)
- Always points to next instruction to execute
- I apologize for my earlier incorrect statement - PC/IP does point to next instruction, not current

1. **Position Independent Code (PIC) Example:**
```c
// Non-PIC: Uses absolute addresses
int global_var = 42;
void func() {
    // Assumes global_var is always at specific address
    printf("%d", global_var);  
}

// PIC: Uses relative addressing
int global_var = 42;
void func() {
    // Calculates global_var location relative to current position
    // Uses GOT to find actual address
    printf("%d", global_var);
}
```

4. **Getting PC Value:**
```nasm
call __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx   ; Call stores next instruction address on stack
; Inside __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx:
mov ebx, [esp]               ; Get return address (PC value)
ret                         ; Return
add ebx, 0x2b64             ; Now ebx = PC + offset to GOT
```
- The `call` instruction pushes return address (next instruction's address) on stack
- `get_pc_thunk` retrieves this value into ebx
- So ebx gets PC value, then 0x2b64 is added to reach GOT

5. **GOT and PIC Relationship:**
```
Memory Layout:
[Program Code]     ; Position can change due to ASLR
[GOT]             ; Table of actual addresses
```
- When code needs global variable/function:
  1. Calculate position-independent offset to GOT
  2. Look up actual address in GOT
  3. Access memory at that address

6. **Absolute vs Relative Addressing:**
```nasm
; Non-PIC (absolute)
mov eax, [0x8048000]        ; Always tries to read from exact address

; PIC (relative)
mov eax, [ebx + offset]     ; Reads from position relative to current code
```
- Non-PIC assumes code/data at fixed addresses
- Won't work if OS loads program at different address (ASLR)
- PIC uses offsets from current position
- GOT provides bridge between relative offsets and actual addresses

7. **Why GOT is Needed:**
- Code needs to be relocatable (ASLR security)
- But still needs to find global variables/functions
- Solution:
  1. Code uses relative offsets to find GOT
  2. GOT contains actual addresses
  3. Loader fills GOT with correct addresses when program loads

Think of it like:
- Non-PIC: "Go to 123 Main Street"
- PIC: "Go 2 blocks north from where you are now, check address book (GOT), then go to that address"
