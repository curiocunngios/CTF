# `TEAM[index-1][strcspn(TEAM[index-1], "\n")] = 0;`
removed '\n' stored in  `TEAM[index-1]`

This line of code:

```c
TEAM[index-1][strcspn(TEAM[index-1], "\n")] = 0;
```

is used to **remove the newline character (`\n`)** from the string stored in `TEAM[index-1]`. Here's a breakdown of what it does step by step:

---

### Breakdown:

1. **`strcspn(TEAM[index-1], "\n")`:**
   - The function `strcspn` (stands for "string complement span") scans the string `TEAM[index-1]` and returns the index of the first character that matches any character in the second string (`"\n"` in this case).
   - In simple terms, it finds the position of the first newline character (`\n`) in `TEAM[index-1]`.
   - If there is no newline character in the string, `strcspn` will return the length of the string.

2. **`TEAM[index-1][...]`:**
   - The expression `TEAM[index-1]` refers to the specific string in the `TEAM` array at position `index-1`.
   - The `[strcspn(TEAM[index-1], "\n")]` part indexes into this string at the position where the newline character is found.

3. **`= 0;`:**
   - This sets the character at the position of the newline (`\n`) to `0`. In C, `0` is the null terminator (`'\0'`), which marks the end of a string.
   - By replacing the newline with a null terminator, the string effectively removes the newline and stops at that point.

---

### Purpose:
When you use functions like `fgets` to read input from the user, the function often includes the newline character (`\n`) at the end of the string if the user presses "Enter". This line removes that newline character so the string doesn't contain it, making it easier to process and compare later.

---

### Example:
Suppose the user enters `FirebUwU` and presses "Enter". The `fgets` function will read:

```
"FirebUwU\n"
```

After this line of code runs:

```c
TEAM[index-1][strcspn(TEAM[index-1], "\n")] = 0;
```

The string becomes:

```
"FirebUwU"
```

The newline character is removed.

---

### Why This Is Important:
- Strings with newlines can cause issues in comparisons, printing, or further processing, as the newline is an unexpected character.
- Removing the newline ensures the string is clean and ready for use.
