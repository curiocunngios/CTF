This is a system call to write data to standard output (the terminal/console). Let's break down each part:

- `write()`: A low-level system call for writing data
- `STDOUT_FILENO`: File descriptor for standard output (usually 1)
- `records[i]->description`: A pointer to the description string/data to be written
- `records[i]->description_size`: The number of bytes to write

In C, it's equivalent to this higher-level code:
```c
printf("%.*s", records[i]->description_size, records[i]->description);
```

The function writes `description_size` bytes from the memory location pointed to by `records[i]->description` to the standard output.

This is often used in CTF/pwn challenges instead of `printf()` because:
1. It's more predictable (no format string vulnerabilities)
2. It writes exactly the number of bytes specified (no null terminator required)
3. It can write binary data containing null bytes

For exploitation purposes, this is important because:
- You can see exactly what's in memory, including any potential leaks
- The size parameter could be manipulated for buffer overflows
- If description pointer is controlled, you could leak arbitrary memory
