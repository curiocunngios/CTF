SOH (Start of Heading) is part of ASCII control characters, which were originally designed for controlling data communications equipment, especially in the early days of teleprinters and modems.

0x01 (SOH) - Start of Heading
- Originally marked the start of a message header
- Used in IBM's Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC)
- Example: SOH + recipient info + STX + actual message

In modern computing:

    Most of these control characters are rarely used for their original purposes
    Some have taken on new meanings (like BEL for terminal notifications)
    Some are still important (NUL for string termination, CR/LF for line endings)
    In your binary, these values (0x01, 0x02) are likely just data rather than being used as control characters
