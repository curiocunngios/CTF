# things learnt today 

1. dockerfile notes
2. heap related vulnerabilities 
3. heap memory allocation 


# this is the second day of writing the above
thought of a pretty good plan:
1. learn heap, reverse
2. learn more binary exploitation techniques from 3633  ( finish content of the second lesson)
3. try out the firebird CTF pwn challenges and understand them throughly (just prcatice)
4. try out HKCERT (simulation, try those with writeups first)
5. 4 - 5 days before the competition: review all your writeups, and others' writeups again 
6. 3 days before the competition: walkthrough (try again) all the homeworks and last year heap pwn from scratch, an empty folder (or brand new kali)


# time allocation for the

# first half (learn and practice with existing firebird materials): 

## 20 % time 
- doing and looking into the problem yourself

## 80% time 
- and focus of reading, watching, listening to learn form the masters 
- review the stuff you learnt in homeworks 
- make notes and flashcards 

# Second half (HKCERT PWN simulation)

## 80% time 
- keep doing and practicing competition mindsets (mindfulness, focus, warrior mentality)
## 20% time 
- writeups, small notes and flashcards
