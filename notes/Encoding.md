Computer represent data in sequences of 0 and 1, i.e. the binary (2元) data. 

These data, these sequences of 0 and 1 are converted back to human-readable format like i.e. those ordinary chiaracters like English alphabets by `Encoding`.

```
Encoding 1:
65 -> ‘A’, 66 -> ‘B’…
Decoding 1:
‘A’ -> 65, ‘B’ -> 66 …
Encoding 2:
1 -> ‘A’, 2 -> ‘B’…
Decoding 2:
‘A’ -> 1, ‘B’ -> 2 …
```

Encoding transforms the data into another format (reversible) that is easier for computer / external
process to read.

## Common encoding

- ASCII
- UTF - 8
- binary (BIN)
- Decimal (DEC)
- Hexadecimal (HEX / Base16)
- Base32
- Base64
- Base58
