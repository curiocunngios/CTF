- so disappointed at picoCTF format string challenge, so shit. Should look for those with higher rating. Also, just....
- first focus on:
1. firebird challenges (including those with unfamiliar environment, setting up docker etc.)
2. hkcertCTF challenges
3. capturing knowledge from your previous challenges, understand them throughroughly, browse through them, the python script, the assembly, the world of pwndbg and ghidra on those challenges specifically, you are not doing pointless thing if u do that


- i think you should jot down notes like the way you think, just pop up some sentences and that's it 
- I feel like sufficating staying at home for a long time and I have a tendency to always go out to have my nice little walk 
- rarely have a continous 6 hours of sleep, easily fall asleep whether eating lorans or not
- There were several times which I woke up earlier and feel glad about it, even if I did not sleep enough at all I didn't care 
- I got so hooked into ctf that whenever I woke up super earlier like 5 am, I had a feeling like "great, time to learn and craft.
- what I am saying here might be result of my own confirmation biases because I have read articles about adhd before and I feel like I am totally one
- spaces out even more 
- i hate myself and I want to change myself, me myself don't accept myself 
- I love learning and modelling the good thing of others 
- Now I am modeling a hard one, the ultimate work embrace, solely getting joy from work and social connections 
- I am now not particularly feeling joyful from work, maybe because I am a bit too impatitnet for the challenges, mindset shifted to solely wanna get flag and abusing AI, not even solving it myself. Unlike how I treat UwUOF++ (didn't really wanna get the flag very badly, just inspecting and wanted to know more)
- forget about progress, forget about flags
- focus on learning, exploring and discovering the world of binaries
- focus on crafting
- focus on being proud of yourself of being able to get joy from the above stuff, unlike your sister lul 
- I was a bit too obsessed in getting flags (solving the challenge) but not learning and taking things slowly (not all the time, I did not, at the start of 7a, 6a, 8a, 9a. But 10a, I just fully don't care about learning, so digusting)




plan for 30/12/2024:

try out firebird competitions challenges (with above mindsets)
- maybe UwUOF+++
- at night writeup time (cherry bomb, or UwUOF+++ potentially)

here are the potential sections:


# chronic symptoms
below are symptoms I have had chronically which I might not have brought up in our first meeting 
- always cannot maintain focus for long. 
- **daytime** either being super tired or overly energized not happily energized, more like stressed-induced, cannot focus and think properly. Rarely feel calm. (had been like this for years but recently it gets to be more serious)
- **always** feel stress and heart palpitations starts out of nowhere for being static, whenever I move something. For example, going for a walk (my favourite thing and I feel the most peaceful and happy doing it), shaking my legs, intensively movements of fingers, I feel calm. This heavily disturbs my reading stage during my studying.  



## Studying 
- if you feel like you are rereading something, even if it's the second time, mark that thing down 

## General flow of studying
You kinda have to do this one, it has to be a game changer
1. hands on exercises
2. make notes, mark down stuff while doing it 
3. refine the notes and add flashcards syntax
4. review previous flashcards 

5/1/2025:
- I am now shaking my legs and getting reminded of restless leg syndrome and magnesium solve (haven't buy yet)
- I am thinking whether sleep was the main root cause, like averaging 6 hours of sleep for years and waking up in the middle of the night for years 
- suspecting myself to have adhd because I always feel stress simply sitting and being static
- overall feeling to the meds: no change at all lol 
- I am starting to feel a bit demotivated (after finishing all track A homework)
- I am starting to feel more stressful lately and have a feeling that my "addictions" are becoming back
- maybe stressful because of the difficulty level up in CTF, I am not sure

# "Addictions" 
video games: clean for nearly a month and not feeling itach, starting to feel itach now  
porn: clean for nearly a month, not feeling itach  
masturbastion: balanced, once every 2 to 3 days   
fast food: clean for nearly a month and feeling itach to eat unhelathy food more or less every day  
twitch: have been clean for 2 weeks. Balanced now, at most 2 hours a week.  
social media: very rarely (nearly never) scroll instagram, reddit, lihkg like how I used to be   

# Sleep 
time takes to fall asleep: nearly instantly  
sleep duration: 5-6 hours everyday  
sleep time: ranges from 9 pm - 1 am, for a month  
Energy level after sleep: Feels decent first, get tired and sleepy very quickly  
My thoughts: Genuinely feel happy for waking early and start my studying on CTF early. So, I did not care much about my sleep duration until the daytime fatigue I get from poor sleep duration became obvious.  

# Reactions to meds 
- feels like nothing, both abilify 10 mg and lorans 0.5 mg (never taken at day time, always taking at night). Tho they might have contributed to my relatively healthier lifestyle right now.
