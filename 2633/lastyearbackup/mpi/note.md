# Challenge description 
```
Naive distributed message encoding machine.

Note: The task is based on MPI (Message Passing Interface) library, so for testing locally you need to setup environment at first (apt should be enough).

nc ash-chal.firebird.sh 36022

Six files are provided:

mpi - the MPI task binary deployed on the task server
flag.txt - fake flag
MPI.c - source file of the task
compile.sh - script for compiel the binary, would be useful if you want to compile on you local environment
exec.sh - MPI wrapper script for executing the binary
env - the docker environment hosting the task
Attachment: mpi.zip

Note: It's recommended to solve the task with the same environment as the remote server, in case any envoronmental issue causing the exp works locally but not on remote server
