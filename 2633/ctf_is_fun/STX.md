STX (Start of Text) is part of ASCII control characters, which were originally designed for controlling data communications equipment, especially in the early days of teleprinters and modems.

0x02 (STX) - Start of Text
- Marked where actual message content begins
- Often paired with ETX (End of Text, 0x03)
- Used in protocols to delimit message boundaries


In modern computing:

    Most of these control characters are rarely used for their original purposes
    Some have taken on new meanings (like BEL for terminal notifications)
    Some are still important (NUL for string termination, CR/LF for line endings)
    In your binary, these values (0x01, 0x02) are likely just data rather than being used as control characters
