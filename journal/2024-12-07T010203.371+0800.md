### Status:
after frustratingly abusing claude-3.5-connet to break 9A homework but all futile attempts 
### Thoughts:

- Sadge
- a bit discouraged
- bro get your focus back and full lock-in for next week challenges as well as the competitions
- focus on doing fundamentals, easier challenges, like reverse, shellcode, etc. and learn all the tricks  
- start viewing the last week video and learn the basic concepts for last week challenges 
- start web fundamentals as well, if time allows
- play some games with relaxed hand, get some energy back perhaps, take a short rest and then you go to bed! Stay excited for challenges! 



ytes 你根本都未熟D基本野

- 學 
- make good use of flashcards and note taking, fixing 
- 其實想學咩 + 想學到幾遠都OK
- 但最好focus, go in depth 那些接近你progress的的知識, 因為你的practice challenges mainly lies here
- far knowledge e.g. ROP, stack migration, just learn the basics for now. And tbh i think there's not much in depth about them, they are just some techniques, the most important thing is to be familiar and very very precise in your knowledge with assembly, coding, tools, libraries,  understanding in memory etc.



- 做多D 80% (由近你現在progress 的開始 ---->基本功 ----> those advanced with techniques -----> keep practicing ----> mixed ones --------> keep practicing!!!!!!!! -----> keeping going and level up more!!!!!!!! -----> trying real-world ones????!!!! -----------> more freedom in the world of computers, binaries ---------> become god in hacking!!!!!!!!!!!  )
