### Status:
after seeing Dr. Wong for the second time
### Thoughts:
- just believe, do not have to think much e.g. (how he might intentionally control the way and stuff he talk to get me hooked, I mean... even if it's true.... who doesn't)
- document observations about yourself daily (CTF as well xD)
- Prepare by appending your previous psychiatry medical notes (what lexapro did to me appended with new prescription and Dr. Wong's words) together with your intention for appointment with doctor in HA 
- The following expected information to be given
    >- psychiatry medical history --> lexapro prescription & change --> new aryzalera & lorans prescription  
    >-  From Dr. Wong: 
    >  ```
```
    >  [11:01 am, 10/12/2024] Dot: Lexapro to OCD was also intended to test if have 傷痕情緒病 (likely if it makes me hype)
[11:02 am, 10/12/2024] Dot: Dangerous if I keep taking it
[11:04 am, 10/12/2024] Dot: It may cause me to not sleep, keep working etc.
[11:07 am, 10/12/2024] Dot: Now hes going to give me some OCD情緒穩定藥 to stablize my current hyper situation
[11:09 am, 10/12/2024] Dot: Feeling a bit munn but "don't really care cuz I'm high and I think I can do it" is a dangerous state in my OCD + lexapro situation
[11:49 am, 10/12/2024] Dot: Taking lorans is not necessary but you should probably call and ask 姑娘 how to take it
would be seeing doctor wong one month later and he intended to buy and keep taking aryzalera and lorans even tho I wont be seeing him in 2 weeks

    >- intention and plan: 
    >  - Having Dr. Wong as my main doctor, who I won't be seeing often because of financial burden, while primarily leveraging HA to get cheaper medicine and emergency adjustment if anything happened
- continue going to school for CTF with healthier food options 
- guitar
- a bit video games at night with strict time limited like forsen (forsen seemed to have broken his discipline and consistency because of POE2 xD)
