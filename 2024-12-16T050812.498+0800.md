### Status:
after waking up early in the morning again
### Thoughts:
- a bit too overconfidence yesterday
- a bit too mindless 
- did not take enough breaks, short and long ones 
- just thought about going down to get coffee to get "that feeling" back but never mind 
- a bit discouraging yesterday 
- but the entirely workflow was great
- exactly what I would expect 
- I am just speedrunning with claude-3.5-sonnet anyways
