I can't wait the send the following message to the CTF discord:

hello everyone, here are my overly detailed and beginner-friendly write-ups of every challenges on firebird training platform 

ofc it does not have to be my first message. I can still learn and ask a lot of questions before all that


ok i am starting to imagine some more conversaitons between me and firebird members xd. Actually maybe no one cares about me xd
