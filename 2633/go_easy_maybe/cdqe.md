`cdqe` (Convert Double to Quad Extended)
- Extends/sign-extends a 32-bit value (eax) to 64-bit (rax)
- In your code snippet, it's extending the result of `sub eax,0x2` to 64 bits
- In Python, you might represent it like this:
```python
# Sign extension from 32-bit to 64-bit
def sign_extend_32_to_64(value):
    # If the 31st bit (sign bit) is 1, extend with 1s, else extend with 0s
    if value & 0x80000000:
        return value | 0xFFFFFFFF00000000
    return value & 0xFFFFFFFF

eax = eax - 2
rax = sign_extend_32_to_64(eax)
```

However, in Python you rarely need to explicitly handle sign extension since Python handles integers with arbitrary precision. The assembly is doing this because it needs to explicitly manage register sizes.

The full sequence:
```assembly
mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]  # Load 32-bit value from memory
sub    eax,0x2                  # Subtract 2
cdqe                           # Sign extend to 64 bits
```

Would be roughly equivalent to:
```python
eax = value_from_memory & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Get 32-bit value
eax = (eax - 2) & 0xFFFFFFFF         # Subtract 2, keep 32 bits
rax = sign_extend_32_to_64(eax)      # Extend to 64 bits
