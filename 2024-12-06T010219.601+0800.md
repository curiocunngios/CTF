### Status:
going to sleep soon (hopefully) actually will just do when my hair is dry
### Thoughts:

proud of myself for being able to turn off sam1268's stream and focus on work right now playing either WoW's ambience & music or brown noise for ADHD xDDD


"small" to-do:
- detailed UwUOF+ write-up 
- write notes
- focus on:
- 1. assembly instructions
- 2. tools instructions
- 3. linux instructions
- 4. good flashcard syntaxes (create new hiearchy to test flashcards)
