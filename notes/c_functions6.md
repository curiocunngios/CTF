```c
  char *end = strchr(buf, '\n');
```

what does the above line mean and do, its in c


This C code searches for the first occurrence of a newline character ('\n') in the string `buf` and stores the memory address in the pointer `end`.

Breaking it down:
- `strchr()` is a C library function that searches for a specific character in a string
- The first parameter `buf` is the string to search in
- The second parameter `'\n'` is the character to find
- If found, it returns a pointer to that character's position
- If not found, it returns NULL

Would you like me to explain more about how strchr works internally or show some example usage?
