# Labels 
- Labels like `<f>`, `<input>`, `<array>`, etc. typically correspond to {{variable names}} from the original C/C++ code
- When you see labels with `.0` suffix like `<input.0>`, it often means the compiler generated a {{temporary/internal}} name for a variable, common with {{scanf/printf arguments}}
