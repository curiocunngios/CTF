# Okay, when I am trying `fix` my notes

What should I do specifically?

which part of my notes should I focus on?

1. Spaced repetition (flashcards) syntax

- Try to see or test whether they work properly
- Do not need to care much about the normal notes reading structure
- flashcards syntax, structing is the most important
- If the flashcards syntax works and you are the guy who wrote the syntaxs yourself, the notes themselves should also be pretty readable in a normal way 

2. Searchability

- To be able to establish linkage between 
- To be able to fix problematic one easily

3. focused notes

- notes focusing on just one particular knowledge point
