this sandbox module requires more knowledge on shellcode, and I don't think the module is that important yet at this moment.

So, I am going to skip it for a while, go forward to race condition, perhaps then file structs, exploitation primitives etc.


so the plan right now is:


race condition --> file struct --> Exploitation primitives --> kernel security / shellcode modules
