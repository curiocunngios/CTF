Hello everyone, I am LI Yat Fung, Alex. Today I will be sharing with you fastbin dup. Before that, let me introduce myself a bit although nobody cares, because I care. I am currently 20 years old, male, my pronoun is he/him, I am single, Also I am pretty mentally ill, actually mentally ill. I am an actual OCD {{writes OCD}} 強迫症 patient. And one of my obsession is related to my information accuracy. I care soooo much about the accuracy of stuff I convey to you guys, so I think I would be most of the time speaking quite slowly. Which might be a little boring but it could also **be a good thing!**. Because it is probably easier for you guys to follow. Ok, that's enough for my introduction. Let's get into code of ethics!

# Code of ethics
Ok code of ethics. So please.... never hack stuff without permission, because what you do might harm the others, it might harm the privacy of the others. And you are likely to make some enemies if you just hack whatever you want. And if somebody is smarter than you, you are like done, it's over for you, it's gg dude cuz you'd probably be going to jail. Anyways, let's finally get into today's topic:fastbin dup
