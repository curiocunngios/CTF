### Thoughts:
it's pretty fun to make notes right now. And I don't really have any stress doign that becuase aty the end I can just write a prompt and ask gpt to help me refine my notes

I am feeling pretty calm right now :)

My gpt points is down to 822,972 already XD


oh just thought of an idea.

When I am writing down notes, I have some questions in my mind right? 

Then I write write down the questions, put a question mark. GPT might also answer the question while refining my notes
