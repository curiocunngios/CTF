# Journal back to mainland

this is the first journal I am writing, to record my journey back to my home town in mainland China. 
It has already been 3 days since I am here. Let's briefly talk about what has happened

## day 1 28/1/2025 
The departure day, the day that I finished tutoring at 3:00 pm and I went on the train with my sister. I was feeling a bit impatient but ok when i had to wait for my sister to get meds for my grandmother in Fanling. Then, what was unexpected was that there were really not many people when you 過關. It was super smooth that I nearly did not have to wait at all, surprisingly. I guess because that was already super close to new year, since that day was exactly the last day of year 2024 in Chinese lunar calendar. 
My sister and I got on a car and smoothly got back home eventually. I slept pretty well on the car. 

Once I got back home, many sorts of anxiety came. For example,
- feeling anxious for not being able to charge my computer 
- feeling anxious for hesitating whether or not to help with washing dishes 
- feeling anxious for hesitating whether or not to wash my own underwear (I did not)
- feeling anxious for wandering around appearing to have nothing to do (now that you have been assigned many tasks on learning, go complete them please)
- feeling anxious for appearing to be selective when it comes to eating.
- feeling anxious for not knowing things and too shy incompetent to ask because of the language barrier
- feeling anxious for the language barrier. 
- feeling anxious for not speaking and in general not contributing anything under any situation 

Lucikly, I have 堂弟 李rui, who is pure, childish and not giving a fuck, blissful, absolutely shameless, seraphic and blessed child who is in general, always happy as hell with me.

I introduced some 2-player video games to him and we played together, specifically Zombie Rush and a few other games together for nearly the entirely night after playing fireworks with my sister and 李rui. 

## day 2 29/1/2025 

Morning: had some buns. Went on a journey together with my uncle and hish wife, and their childd (李智 and rui) to first get a converter for my fast charging charger, proceeds to go to 茶園, a beautiful place as my uncle's wife wanted to go there. Lastly, we went to a temple to 拜神 where I nearly burnt my fucking hand entirely, got blame the victim'd and had that rent free in my mind. 


Afternoon, went to watch a basketball match with 李rui  where I met my sister's friends, I recognised one of them and I got intereted in her, kinda jerked off to her that night. 李rui ha dbeen busy riding oon his bike and I was just following him sweating a lot. 
After that, we went home early and I he then bought a toy gun to play with for 15 dollars of cash lol. 
Next, he picked up his homework from his schoolbag and I noticed that he was basically just insane with how quickly his state of mind, focus could be switched from one thing to other ( homework), and being so fucking deeply focused into the homework that he literally immediately started writing and marking stuff after hiding his toy gun and the toy water bullets under a cup of water. 
I got motivated because of that and i start "working" as well, which was pretty much 裝模作樣

my actual working started at night: I explored a bit on CTF stuff and planned for what to do. Then, I started reading an interesting book where the frog visits a psychologist as it was suggested by 李rui and that I was a bit interesting in the book long time ago.

the anxiety I had in day 1 has been lowered and it was pretty much ok 
## day 3

Morning: had a lot of noddles and yummy 肉園. Visted q娘, got sexually interested in ( probably 二嫂(?)) because she had some really nice toes and she doesn't look bad. And yep I kinda jerked off to her in the afternoon. I started karaoke which was fun and sadly 二嫂 and most of the others were there for my voice, they went somewhere else shortly after our visits. 

Afternoon: did nearly nothing except that I played one Zombie Rush match and some little games with my little brother 李rui and about 2 hours after that my another uncle (my father's bigger brother) visited and I was caliming that I was doing my "homework" while downloading a game called "Mini world" while writing C notes from mypast challenges. Uh that was rewarding anyway. 

Night: Went with my sister and 李rui for another karaoke session with mainly my sisters' friend. I had an strong intention of trying flex my English with some English song requests, which was probably not very successfully since I was literally fucking shaking and I didn't sang really well. Other than that I had some more song choices for the songs thaat I liked. For example, 萬一你是個好人, something just like this, poker face, 愛的魔法, etc.  To be honest, that was not a very fun experience to me since the miccrophoen was a bit too loud. And it was probably not a fun experience to the others as well since most of their song choices has been covered by me and my sisters' song requests lol. 

And Now I am here writing this, going to read the book in a second and went to bed very very soon. 

## day 4 

Morning:  I had the worst sleep within these few days and I woke up at around 10:000 am. My first meal was lunch with many eggs which was tasty

Afternoon: I layed video games, Mini World with my little brother until around 1:30 pm and that was totally not fun. After that, i started doing my "homework". I, again, took quite a long time to get into the state of mind of hardworking and focused on doing the work. I worked on 5 very verys imple C programs until around 5 pm. Then, I started working on a reverse engineering challenge `beleaf`, I started reversing and then i realized that there's a bit too much to reverse by hand. So i decided to open ghidra for that and then nit's dinner time.

Night: the fried eggs were salty as hell holy shit. I played the remaining fireworks with my little brother and I also played Mini world again with him, it was soooooooooooo boring lol. I kept mamking excuses of not playing by saying that I need some rest. Then, I told him to have rest as well and we went down stairs the watch TV together with grandmother. nothing special happened today. I went back here and I 
jerked off to a manga called rosen garden saga.


## day 5 

morning: woke up at around 9:42, woken up by my little brother 李rui again. Had a terrible breakfast, I don't know what that is, it's too sweet

afternoon: had lunch with 姑姑 x 2, didn't have too much interactions with them. I remember trying to pretend being focused on my "homework" and readings but in fact I weren't able to focus at all, because I was not feeling very comfrotable around many people and since it was a bit noisy. After they're gone, I came back my room to have a 1 hour nap. Then, I had some thoughts in my braina nd it took a while since I was able to get my mind back on the reverse task. Unfortunately, I failed the task and I had to read the answer lol. Then, here it came, finally the time that I wanted to take a shit and shower time, perfect. The poop taking awas not very successful since I was exhausted after taking just a little bit of shit but it was enough. Next, dinner time right after my bath. I am 100% sure that the chopsticks I used was dirty as fuck lol, but I did not care and continued eating. Since I don't want to be somebody annoying telling them to swap my chopsticks. 

night: played video games with 李rui, it was boring at the start playing mini world with him. But later it gets fun since we switched back to 2p games 1v1. I feel a bit disappointed in myself after losing tic tac toe to him.


## day 6

morning: woke up early to eat yummy af noodles with yummmmmmmmmmmmmy af meatballs. My sister went on the car at around 9 am with the black git . Then, at around 10:00 am, we went to a place which was boring af so I brought out my computer to play

afternoon: after having lunch at that place, I played 飛行棋 with my little brother 李rui, won all that and the computer ran out of battery. Then, 叔 brought me to the place to get on the car bcack to hong kong. I slept pretty well on the car and there was a bit of traffic constipation at the end

night: brought some food (油豆腐) to my aunt's restaurant and got on 277X back home. I was feeling uncomfrotable on the 277X as I have a huge GIT with me on the second floor, I learnt tha tI shouldn't rbing it to the second floor

thoughts overall. I missed the place. Especially that huge comfortable bed I slept with. I missed the cute pikachu pillow, I missed the pillow I slept with, I missed the smell of the bed that I can't help but ket smelling my the clothes I slept with (that has the smell) when I am back to HK. And I missed 李rui and a little of my grandmother of course. Really do looking forward to go back next year. The only bad thing is the toilet and the food and the socialising part, nothing else.
