What to do right now and for the rest of the week:

# focus management
- 25 mins full lock in sections per 5 mins guitar break

# general flow: 
- Start with warm-up with familiar stuff 
- move on to sections for knowledge you targeted to learn

Habit:
1. make quick notes by copying whenever you understand something from claude-3.5-sonnet 

# Simply relax, focus and enjoy

- The sense of tranquility you get from reading and learning

- The excitement during process of figuring out new things

- Th fulfillment of your curiosity

- The process of understanding things
- The sense of achievement of being able to understand

- The feeling you get when you sense the connection between different knowledge
- The fulfillment of being able to create things
- The sense of achievement of being able to break things
- The connection between you and people in communities you are in (asking, answering questions and sharing feelings)

  

# At night

- small walk 
- bath 
- notes fixing 
- writing write-ups 
- perhaps flashcards reviewing
- perhaps watch some stream (don't get obsessed as they are not your focus)
- sleep

覺得能夠鬆懈, reward 自己更多嘅時候, 往往係最最最最最危險嘅時候 - Dr. Alex Lam
I totally agree with this. That's always the start of losing balance and nightmare procrastination

### **Final Notes**
- **Adjust Flexibly**: If a topic feels difficult, allocate extra time but don’t skip weaker areas.  
- **Celebrate Progress**: Small wins build momentum and confidence.  
- **Stay Consistent**: Daily effort will yield results over time.

## what to do tmr (briefly)
- start reversing
- start web
- document
## What to do for now

- review chat logs with claude on past week for buffer overflow challenges 
- make notes and fix notes for your progress of the entire week (review)
- make handbook (future, by sending that gpt a message reveal your progress and getting a new plan)
- again, enjoy the process of creating and the progress you have made!
