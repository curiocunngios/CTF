# Plan for the following 2 months

So the presentation topics has already been released. I do not want to be miserable, not at all. So I am already preparing for my presentation and I have started writing the beginning of my script. But there's still some major problems:
1. lagging brain 
2. emotion control (nervousness, excited) 
3. hardware devices (mic, headset) 
4. confidence level

To address each of the above problem, here is the solution:
### lagging brain
- sleep well every day
- get rid of your porn addiction brother, just jerk off to literally nothing and that's fine.
- mindfulness
- practice focus
- speak more (ctf related stuff)
- document and speak during the process of you pwning (for the demo section) 
### emtion control 
- take meds
- sleep well every day 
- mindfulness 
### hardware devices 
- just buy, like literally starting from tomorrow
### confidence level 
- Enough preparation, starting right now, you will be ok. Just speak more, document yourself pwning and speaking about it. Speak every moment and every details about pwn as if you are teaching somebody, for literally all the time. Also, you got to speak louder, even if your sister is at home (that's even better, cuz you are basically telling everyone that you are doing something, you are not playing video games, isn't it?)


## Actual preparation
To be able to start actually practicing the documentation process, and start familarizing yourself with your actual presentation script (which the topic might fluctuate due to your interest over time), you really should start investing time on investigating very very deeply into the pwn topics. For example, fastbin dup. From knowing the origin of the name (fastbin duplicate), to knowing everything about it and doing at least a few challenges related to it. Gain experiences and knowledge related to the topic so that you have a lot to elaborate on your presentation and make sure everything is as detailed as possible.

To do so, start by looking at how2heap https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap 
play with the binaries and the source code! And of course, the challenges! Spend days on them! 

Ok before everything, first resolve your insecurity about the coursework (COMP2011 AND COMP2711) by spending 2 hours on them daily

adjustment and adaptation is also very important. Since you are basically fantasizing yourself being able to manage studying and cramming a ton of knowledge and challenges. 

I kinda afraid that I may lost the 幹勁 that I have right now 










# Daily to do:
1. 2-3 hours of coursework in the morning 
2. explore the world of ctf
3. misc (e.g. registering activities, events, etc.)
4. guitar, walk, fruits, forsen, anime
## To do after coursework

1. actively research into the heap topic - fastbin dup
- https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/tree/master
- google more
- claude more
- make notes
- try out the challenges, spend days on it. Take breaks


2. Improve pwn skills (heap) 
- pwn college dynamic allocator misuse   
https://pwn.college/program-security/dynamic-allocator-misuse/  
try out the challenges and watch the videos

3. Improve reverse skills (foundation building)
- pwn college reverse engineering module from program security 
https://pwn.college/program-security/reverse-engineering/

4. Improve programming skills and help comp2011 (foundation building)
- leetcode problems


again, you are now just probably fantasizing yourself being able to learn effectively with the above materials and together with claude. But it might not be the case. Always adapt and micro adjust.

Take your time to learn slowly during the process
