### Status:
after taking a break playing guitar with extremely shaky hand but quite fun at the end cuz I played pretty fast and good on a song i like 
### Thoughts:

I am thinking about a brief plan for tonight, inherented (not sure if I am using ht eword correctly) from the general plan genreated by dear chatgpt


- continue with pomodro timer
- take guitar breaks regular, with nothing else
- keep learning basics by going deeper from the cutting-edge concepts on the second-lastest lecture slide 
- start easy, and related beginner friendly challenges, or sample programs generated by chatgpt, walk through them while being guided, or not guided
- maybe keep going with similar challenges and document
- refine the basics and your own notes
- set up obsidian sync on your phone perhaps

new plan as follow:
- boost your understanding of GOT hijacking first, because you have just viewed relevant contents
- then you go review buffer overflow (perhaps go look at quote's demo)
- then go do relevant buffer overflow challenges
- then go review shell code (ret2shellcode ? )
- boost understanding by watching demo / + trying out relevant challenges
- view the contents of ROP, by watching videos or exploring with gpt (your choice, or perhaps try both)
- try out relevant challenges and boost understanding
- go into the lastest video I guess.
