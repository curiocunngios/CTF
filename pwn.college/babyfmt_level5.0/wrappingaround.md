I'm glad it worked! Let me explain the wrap-around concept more clearly:

### Why Wrap-Around Is Needed

When using `%hn`, we're writing a 16-bit value (2 bytes). The key is that `%hn` **only writes the lowest 16 bits** of the current character count.

Here's what happens in your case:

1. After the first `%44202c%22$hn`, you've printed 44202 (0xacaa) characters.

2. You want to write 0x24b3 (9395) to the next address, but you've already printed more characters than that.

3. If you try to directly print 9395 characters, you'd need to "go backwards" which is impossible.

### How Wrap-Around Works

Think of a 16-bit counter that goes from 0 to 65535 (0xFFFF) and then wraps back to 0. This is exactly how the `%hn` modifier behaves:

- When the counter reaches 65536 (0x10000), it wraps around to 0
- Only the lowest 16 bits get written to memory

So to get from 44202 (0xacaa) to 9395 (0x24b3), we need to:
1. Keep counting up until we reach 65536
2. Then continue counting until we reach 9395 again

The math is:
- Distance from 44202 to 65536 = 21334
- Plus distance from 0 to 9395 = 9395
- Total distance = 30729

When you print 30729 more characters, the total is 44202 + 30729 = 74931 (0x124b3)
But `%hn` only writes the lowest 16 bits, which is 0x24b3, exactly what you wanted!

### Visual Explanation
```
0     9395(0x24b3)                44202(0xacaa)     65535(0xFFFF)
|------|---------------------------|----------------|
        ↑                           ↑                ↑
    Your target                Current count        16-bit limit
        
After wrapping around once:

0     9395(0x24b3)                44202(0xacaa)     65535(0xFFFF) → 0     9395(0x24b3)
|------|---------------------------|----------------|             |------|
        ↑                           ↑                              ↑
    Your target                Current count                 New count after
                                                          printing 30729 more chars
```

That's why printing 30729 more characters gets you to 0x24b3, which is what you want to write to the second address.
