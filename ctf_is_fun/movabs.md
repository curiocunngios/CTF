Let me break this down:

1. **movabs vs mov**:
- Regular `mov` instruction uses a 32-bit immediate that gets sign-extended to 64 bits
- `movabs` uses a special opcode (B8-BF with REX.W) that allows full 64-bit immediate
- Notice how the encoding is split: `48 b8` followed by 8 bytes of immediate value

`movab` is able to load a full 64-bit value
```apache
1198:	48 b8 3f e5 5a 6e 42 	movabs rax,0x29c4e0426e5ae53f
```

Let me break this down step by step:

1. **Instruction Encoding**
- `48` is the REX.W prefix (indicates 64-bit operation)
- `b8` is the opcode for mov to rax
- The next 8 bytes `3f e5 5a 6e 42 e0 c4 29` are the actual value
- This splitting in machine code shows how the CPU reads/processes the instruction

2. **mov vs movabs**
```nasm
mov rax, 0x1234        ; Small number - regular mov works
mov rax, 0x123456789   ; Too big - needs movabs
```
- Regular `mov` can only handle immediates up to 32 bits
- If you use larger numbers, they get truncated or need `movabs`
