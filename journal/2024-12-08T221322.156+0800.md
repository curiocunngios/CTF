### Status:
starting to go back to CTF
### Thoughts:
In the recent 2 days after I felt really good doing buffer overflow challenges and making a legitimate write-up for the a firebird training challenge as well as reading the stack migration notes, understood everything and felt a bit like speed running and genius ~~xD~~

I felt lost but instead the best way (part of me want to continue to do some more buffer overflow challenges, part of me want to focus on assembly, part of me want to start web, part of me want to continue stack migration and ROP since I have just started to learn and amazed by those techniques.)


There's a bit too much options for me, the self learner who has to catch up a lot of progress from here, but I guess the best option is to actually focus on kind of following the firebird path and the firebird challenges

flashcards and notes taking are ways to help me learn faster, utilized them but not fully rely on them (which was my master plan for assembly) but I think the reversing category is not just that, it's probably not just assembly

So it's better to clean up those firebird challenges still

goal1: write write-ups for all challenges presented in the firebird training before new year.
1. continue buffer overflow by starting the one in picoCTF( you worked on them last week), treat it as a warm up

2. try the one on firebird training site

4. keep documenting the process with writeups, notes taking. etc.

5. remember, don't get frustrated because you don't feel like you don't have enough time. No, you do, as long as you don't get bothered with something else like stream watching and video games which takes the most of your time really really fast with you being mindful enough to notice during the process.

6. So you do not have to worry about "wasting" time on seeing a doctor, attending a briefing section etc. (just make notes and review the flashcards with your phone at that time lol)

7. You have a month left and ych also takes hours to solve a challenge. Imagine that you also need that much of time + time for learning, it is totally possible to learn everything before the competition

8. And since you are aiming to be the absolute best, getting rank 1 solo. Then you really reall relal really reeally really have to try your best to capture everything, everything single fucking essential knowledge with note taking and flashcards reviewing while being fast enough to overcome to current challenges and get ready to practice a lot more (rather than just firebird CTF) to surpass all the others

ok i feel
