# Size of memory references
We sometime need to define the size of memory references, {{variable type}} can also be determined from how large the memory references are. We need to specify the size if the assembler cannot infer the size from other operands

- word :: 1 word = 2 bytes
- dword :: double word = 2 words = 4 bytes
- qword :: quad word = 4 words = 8 bytes
