Ok, initially, I thought that today is the most trash day I have ever have. Because I literally have done nothing else other than reading the source code, the decompiled source code of a heap ctf challenge. I didn't manage to solve the challenge, I didn't manage to move on and take care of my academics which I am currently falling behind the class' progress already. I didn't manage to keep myself energized during the source code reading because: 1. it was just a bit too high level and too frustrating to read through, to learn through. Indeed I jumped out of my comfort zone a bit too much. 

But, it is actually all about how I look at up this. I may think that I am a sleepy trash who cannot code and who cannot read code. But the thing is, I am indeed encountering something that overwhelms me at this moment, right? Which means this is exactly the perfect opportunity to learn, to at least know a little bit about it, isn't it? It is a perfect chance to consume some knowledge you don't quite know, which you figured out by getting overwhelmed with it. Therefore, go ahead and consume it! Work on academics stuff tomorrow la! No further procrastination allowed!

I have just watched dafran's stream, seeing him being chill playing video game as a bipolar makes me wanna reflect something but I don't know what that is. Actually, I feel a bit like back when I was a kid for a second. But I do not know why. Maybe it's because of the meds? Because of Abilify balancing the level of serotonin? Maybe I should stop chasing honor in cybersecurity or among peers? Maybe I should just go ahead to enjoy some video games myself?
Or maybe I should try to make ctf as enjoyable as video games. CTF certainly gives a certain level of enjoyment (I felt it after solving questions that I think is hard or interesting)

It's also quite interesting to see those pro CS (counter strike) players being so good, their elegant movements, top-notch skills. The sort of 所向披靡 level. Which is something I wish to get in at least some fields, because it just looks so fucking dope, it is soooooooooooo fucking cool.
