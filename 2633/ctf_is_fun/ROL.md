`rol rdx,cl` performs a "rotate left" operation on the `rdx` register, where the number of positions to rotate is specified by the value in `cl` (lower 8 bits of rcx).

For example, if:
- `rdx` contains `0b1100` (12)
- `cl` contains `1`
- After `rol rdx,cl`, `rdx` would contain `0b1001` (9)

Because:
```
Original:  1100
Rotate 1:  1001  (leftmost 1 wraps around to the right)
```
1 100 and leftmost `1` did not falls off, instead it goes to rightmost position

Python equivalent:
```python
def rol(value, shift, bits=64):  # 64 for rdx (64-bit register)
    shift = shift & (bits - 1)  # Normalize shift count
    return ((value << shift) | (value >> (bits - shift))) & ((1 << bits) - 1)

# Example usage
value = 12          # Value in rdx
shift = 1           # Value in cl
result = rol(value, shift)
```

Key differences from regular left shift (`<<`):
- In ROL, bits that "fall off" the left end wrap around to the right
- In regular shift, bits that "fall off" are lost

This operation is common in:
- Cryptography
- Hash functions
- Bit manipulation algorithms


Let's break down the ROL (rotate left) operation step by step:

1. First, understand what we want:
```python
# Example with 4 bits for simplicity
value  = 0b1100   # Original value
shift  = 1        # Rotate left by 1

# We want: 0b1001
# Because: 1100 -> 1001 (leftmost 1 moves to rightmost position)
```

2. Let's break down the Python code:
```python
def rol(value, shift, bits=64):
    # Step 1: Normalize shift count
    # If bits=64, then bits-1 = 63 = 0b111111
    # This ensures shift is never >= 64
    shift = shift & (bits - 1)    

    # Step 2: Split into two parts
    left_part = value << shift           # Shift left
    right_part = value >> (bits - shift) # Wrap-around part
    
    # Step 3: Combine parts with OR
    result = left_part | right_part
    
    # Step 4: Mask to ensure we stay within our bit width
    mask = (1 << bits) - 1
    final = result & mask
    
    return final

# Example with small numbers
value = 0b1100  # 12 in decimal
shift = 1
result = rol(value, 4)  # Will rotate: 1100 -> 1001
```

3. Simpler example with 4-bit numbers:
```python
# Using 4-bit numbers for clarity
def rol4bit(value, shift):
    # Ensure we work with 4 bits
    shift = shift & 0b11  # 4-1 = 3 = 0b11
    
    # Example: value = 0b1100, shift = 1
    left = value << shift          # 1100 -> 1000
    right = value >> (4 - shift)   # 1100 -> 0001
    
    result = left | right          # 1000 | 0001 = 1001
    return result & 0b1111         # Keep only 4 bits

# Test
print(bin(rol4bit(0b1100, 1)))  # Should print 0b1001
```

The complexity comes from:
1. Handling wraparound
2. Dealing with arbitrary bit widths
3. Making sure we don't lose bits
