- if during the day time, you have this "I Don't know where I am, what I am doing feeling"
- starting journalling with thoughts and writeups of the challenge which you were currently on 
- now I have been having many thoughts since I woke up 
- which includes: 
  - having to find receipts, reply email 
  - having to bring my phone to school and call my "student" today 
  - a bit frustrated on trying to figure out what did I do bad yesterday: (probably just having my brain off, not patient enough to go deeper and read gpt's strategies on the challenge)
  - basically if you are able to confirm the key knowledge points of a challenge, I think you're good, what's left is the puzzle part, which you can always ask in the firebird discord channel as well     

Now my target is to:
- start memory hero:
- find similar but simpler challenges and learn 
- move on to pwn (if I finished within today, or if I feel like I won't make much progress on memory hero fast enough now)
- at night reverse 102 video at night

perhaps I am a bit too obsessed with CTF now that I feel like:
- touching my phone for a second wastes my time (i hope my "student" found another tutor tbh)
- I am in love with the state that I hate getting disturbed by phone 
I think you can pretty much still use it
just use it during your large break, which large break is usually necessary:
- night walk 
- lunch break
- morning before school 

Now my target is to:
- start memory hero:
- find similar but simpler challenges and learn 
- move on to pwn (if I finished within today, or if I feel like I won't make much progress on memory hero fast enough now)
- at night reverse 102 video at night

# Memory hero 
- find similar challenges and learn fast
- just try and learn fast from it 
- mark down key knowledge points like how you did for previous two reverse challenges (most important) 
- don't make too many guesses, and of course not with insufficient knowledge
