Excellent question! This is a key insight into reverse engineering. Here are the clues that tell us the correct struct layout:

## Clue 1: The Function Call Assembly

```asm
mov    rax, qword ptr [rsp + 0x100]  // Load function pointer
mov    rdi, rsp                      // Load buffer address  
call   __x86_indirect_thunk_rax      // Call function(buffer)
```

The critical line is `mov rdi, rsp` - this loads **the start of the struct** (`rsp`) as the first argument. This tells us that `logger.buffer` must be at the **beginning** of the struct (offset 0).

## Clue 2: The C Code Logic

```c
(*logger.log_function)(logger.buffer);
```

This calls the function with `logger.buffer` as the argument. Since the assembly shows `mov rdi, rsp`, we know:
- `logger.buffer` = address of the struct start = offset 0
- `logger.log_function` = read from `[rsp + 0x100]` = offset 0x100

## Clue 3: How Arrays Work in C

If the struct were:
```c
struct logger {
    void (*log_function)(char *);  // 8 bytes at offset 0
    char buffer[256];              // 256 bytes at offset 8
};
```

Then `logger.buffer` would be at offset 8, and the assembly would be:
```asm
mov rdi, rsp + 8    // NOT what we see!
```

But we see `mov rdi, rsp`, which means the buffer starts at offset 0.

## Clue 4: The Initialization Code

```c
logger.log_function = printk;
```

This line sets the function pointer. If we look at where this value ends up, it's at the location that gets read by `[rsp + 0x100]`, confirming the function pointer is at offset 0x100.

## Clue 5: Your Exploit Success

Your exploit worked because you put:
- Command at offset 0 → becomes `logger.buffer` (passed as argument)
- Function pointer at offset 0x100 → becomes `logger.log_function` (gets called)

If the layout were reversed, your exploit would have failed because:
- The wrong data would be passed as the argument
- The wrong data would be treated as the function pointer

## Visual Confirmation

```
Your payload layout:
Offset 0x000: "/bin/chmod 777 /flag\0"  ← This becomes logger.buffer (arg to function)
Offset 0x100: run_cmd_address           ← This becomes logger.log_function (function to call)

Assembly behavior:
mov rdi, rsp        ← Loads offset 0 as argument (your command)
mov rax, [rsp+0x100] ← Loads offset 0x100 as function (your function pointer)
```

The fact that your exploit worked perfectly confirms that `buffer` is at offset 0 and `log_function` is at offset 0x100.

This is a great example of how successful exploitation can actually **prove** the memory layout you've reverse-engineered!
