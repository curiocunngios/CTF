### Status:
after playing overwatch for about 3 hours and watched sam1268 for a while 
### Thoughts:
feels incredibly bad 
is it because i have brainwashed myself to switch an identity as a hacker but does not successfully transform to that community quickly enough?
I felt good and kind of believed I have turned good and things would all turn good 

- importance of self control (told myself to not play much, did not set a time limit, keeps playing thinking it's fine to keep going, kept going)
- did not manage to resist my itch on playing video games( I am indeed a bit worried about not playing and having a bounce back, oh nvm, last week i haven't played for an entire week lmao)
- i felt super guilty for playing tonight because there was a moment that i felt like i was super close to completely detach myself from games when i felt calm reading the notes. 
- I guess the main problem is still me having too much in my mind!!! Just do what you wanna do at that moment lol (remember not to binge video games still!) 
- u wanted to keep reading, just do it
- u wanted to play games for a while, just do it
- u can't wait to try out some ctf challenges, just do it and forget about overwatch
- lol 

now imma review some flashcards and go to bed
lol this is the day i felt so good and felt like im going to do a lot but did nothing lol
