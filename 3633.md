# After chatting with Alex 
- likely getting B range 
- unlikely to get into comp4633 unless I show exceptional pwn skills, or do exceptionally in the ctfs (even more unlikely since I do not know other categories)
- the point is showing your worthiness via CTFs
- I am likely getting into comp3633 next year 
- There is a risk that there's not much pwn challenges 

# Select now
## pros 
- potential longer duration as firebird member
- appear to be honourable in front of friends (future 2633 students)
- potential to be firebird leader 
- early good CV
## cons
- high risk of no 4633 ( I only got pwn to prove myself)
- bearing risk, more stressful
- bearing bad foundation (don't even know basics python), might have to abuse AIs, less fun
- risk of not yet stablizing yourself

# Select in year 3 
## pros 
- longer time to fully equip myself
- lower risk of no 4633 
- less stressful (really? while bearing 3000 level comp courses wor)
- might be able to take with my friends (nigel, cubic, etc.)
## cons
- can't become leader anymore



# what to do 
starting from tomorrow, again full focus on pwn topics, nightmare and lactf 
- reversing skills 
- ROP
- SROP
- heap 
until the end of tuesday 

then at the start of wednesday, try out the selected ctf (look up ctfarchive)
if you can comfortably work on the pwn challenges (like how you speedran the first few nightmare buffer overflow challenges)
then you join 3633

but if that went terribly 
do not join 

if that feels decent
if you feel 



## a few more questions 
Alex mentioned that I can spend prepare myself even better for next year's comp3633. Is it possible that I take comp3633 this year and being not good enough, then prove myself with soloing challenges and get into comp4633?
