Let me break these assembly instructions down:

`jmp 1195` - Jump instruction
- In Python, this would be like a `goto` (which Python doesn't have)
- It's essentially an unconditional jump to another location in code
- Most similar to:
```python
while True:
    # or
continue
# or
break
```
depending on the context.
